objects have state(fields) and behavior(methods)

oven:
    state: current temp, goal temp, isOn, isConnectedToPower
    behavior: heatUp, turnO

hiding data behind methods is called data encapsulation

benefits of oop:
    modularity
    information-hiding
    code re-use
    pluggability and debugging ease
